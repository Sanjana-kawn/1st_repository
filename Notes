*Version control system* is a toll that helps to track changes in code.

*Git* is a version control system.it is:(A)popular (B)free and open source (c)fast and reliable.
Two main reasons to use git:(A)track the history (B) to collaborate.

*Github*
website that allows developers to store & manage their code using git. (https://github.com/)
>uploaded in the form of folders.
>folders are called repository(short form- repo).

**some commands**
>`pwd`-for seeing the working directory.
>`ls`-for seeing all the files/documents.
>`clear`-to clear the screen.

*configuring git*
>telling git in which account will we be making changes.
>if we make changes on github using git then through which email_id do we want to do it,what name do we want associate with it.
**commands** 
>`git config --global user.name "user_name"`
>`git conig --global user.email "email_address"`
>`git config --list`
there are two type of configuration-global or local
In global the changes we make through our system in github will all show up in the main email id.
In local configuration  the changes are made for a specific project or repo using a special email id for it.

**Git Basic Commands**
*clone - cloning a repository on oour local machine.
       >`git clone <-some link->`
*status - displays the status of code
       >`git status`

*when folders are created there are two types of it: a) visible file  b) hidden file
*To access hidden files(or all files) use command: `ls -a`
>*.git* folder is a hidden file, it can be accessed through `ls -a` command.This file shows that the folder/file is being tracked/recorded.

now in our local system(vs code for example) changes made and saved will make the folder look <yellow> in colour and show "M" sign which means that 'file is modified'.
after modifying the file there is a twoste procedure which is : add -> commit.
>to restore the file to its original form before it was modified,use command: `git restore <filename>` 


when we use `git status` command, generally there are 4 stages:
(a)  untracked - new file that git doesn't yet track
(b) modified - changed
(c) staged - file is ready to be commited.(when file is get added but not commited yet)
(d) unstaged - unchanged.(commited file)

*add and commit command*
add- adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.
     `git add <-file name->`
*to add all the modified file at once use : `git add .`

commit - it is the record of change.
        `git commit -m"some message"`

push command :-upload local(our computer) repo content to remote(github) repo.
               `git push`


if you are facing this kind of problem:
 $ git add
fatal: Unable to create 'C:/Users/JJ/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

use the command: `rm -f ./.git/index.lock`
